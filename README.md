##  Problem Statement

**AtliQ Grands** is facing a decline in revenue and market share due to growing competition and ineffective decision-making. As part of their strategic initiative to integrate data intelligence, they hired a data analyst (me!) to uncover key business insights from their historical data and help drive smarter decisions.

---

##  Objective

- Identify patterns in **revenue, occupancy, ADR, RevPAR**
- Analyze **cancellation/no-show rates** and their impact on revenue
- Evaluate **performance across booking platforms, room classes, and properties**
- Provide **strategic recommendations** to optimize revenue and efficiency

##  Dataset Overview

The project is based on 5 CSV files:

| File Name                   | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `dim_date.csv`             | Contains calendar details like date, week no, month, and day type |
| `dim_hotels.csv`           | Information about hotel properties including city and category |
| `dim_rooms.csv`            | Room category mapping (Standard, Premium, etc.) |
| `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` | Daily aggregated room booking data (bookings & capacity) |
| `fact_bookings.csv`        | Individual booking records with status, revenue, and ratings |

---

##  KPIs Calculated

- **Revenue** – Total and Realized
- **RevPAR** (Revenue per Available Room)
- **ADR** (Average Daily Rate)
- **Occupancy Rate**
- **Realization %**
- **Cancellation %**
- **Average Ratings**

---

##  Tools Used

- **Power BI** – Dashboard design, DAX calculations, visualization, data modelling


---

##  Key Insights

-  **Revenue dropped by 81.7% in Week 32** while ADR remained steady — potential seasonal or demand-side issue.
-  **Cancellation rate of 24.83%** led to ~₹199M in lost revenue — policy or reminder systems needed.
-  **Bangalore and Hyderabad underperforming** despite large capacities — explore local marketing strategies.
-  **Weekends have higher occupancy (44.2%)** than weekdays — suggest adjusting weekday pricing.
-  **Tripster has highest ADR (₹12,780)** but lowest volume — potential to scale revenue via targeted offers.

---




##  Recommendations

- Revise pricing strategy to balance **ADR vs Occupancy** and boost **RevPAR**
- Reduce cancellations through flexible policies and **pre-arrival reminders**
- Prioritize marketing for properties with **high ratings but low bookings**
- Strengthen partnerships with **platforms providing high ADR & realization**
